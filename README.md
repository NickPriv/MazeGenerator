# MazeGenerator
A randomized depth-first search is exectuted on an nxm grid graph, and the resulting spanning tree is printed to the console as a maze. The destination, marked with '?', is the leaf that is the greatest distance from the root, determined by a breadth-first search of the tree.  <br /><br />

The start is marked with 'S' and the destination is marked with '?'. Paths are blank and walls are marked with an 'X'. See the samples for examples of mazes this program can generate.
